## Overview
This project aims to:
- **Automate** compatibility assessments for modular products using **AI** and **AutoML**.
- Provide a **user-friendly interface** so that non-technical stakeholders can easily predict and interpret compatibility scores.
- Highlight how **modular product architectures** can streamline manufacturing, reduce complexity, and adapt to evolving stakeholder requirements.

### Main Contributions
1. **Modular Product Architecture**: Demonstrates step-by-step modular decomposition, design-for-variety, and component grouping.
2. **AI / Machine Learning Integration**: 
   - Uses **AutoML** (through PyCaret) to select optimal regression models for predicting compatibility scores.
   - Illustrates how a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface can be deployed for real-time predictions.
3. **Framework & Evaluation**: 
   - Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (using metrics like \( R^2 \) and RMSE), and result visualization.
